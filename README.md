## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Query
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

- It's my first using font awesome icons in my project, I've always used svgs. While integrating Font awesome into my project, I ran into some issues, the icons were not showing. So it taught me the right ways of linking and not so great way of linking resources.
